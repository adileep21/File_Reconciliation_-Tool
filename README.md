# ðŸ“Š File Reconciliation Tool

## Overview  
The **P-C and C-P Tool** is a Streamlit-based application that compares two datasets (Primary and Secondary) based on a unique identifier. It allows users to:  
âœ” Find **exact matches** while prioritizing primary file columns.  
âœ” Identify **records present only in the primary file** (keeping only primary file columns).  
âœ” Identify **records present only in the secondary file** (keeping only secondary file columns).  

## Features  
- **Upload Files**: Supports CSV and Excel formats.  
- **Custom Column Matching**: Users can select the unique identifier for comparison.  
- **Flexible Filtering**: Choose from **Exact Matches, Primary-Only, or Secondary-Only** records.  
- **Download Results**: Export filtered data in Excel format.  

## How to Use  
1. Upload the **Primary** and **Secondary** files.  
2. Select the **unique identifier** for comparison.  
3. Choose an operation:  
   - **Exact Matches** â†’ Retains all columns but prioritizes the primary file's values.  
   - **Records only in Primary** â†’ Keeps only primary file columns.  
   - **Records only in Secondary** â†’ Keeps only secondary file columns.  
4. Preview the results and download the processed file.
